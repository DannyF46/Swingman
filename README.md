# Swingman (working title)
See [itch.io](https://dannyf46.itch.io/swingman) for an executable version of the game.

A little prototype for a game about using a grapple hook, sometimes for platforming and sometimes for solving physics-related puzzles!

### **Note**: 
This project has been something of a "learners project" for me, which means I have been learning C# and Unity _while_ making the game. To me, the code feels hacky and poorly documented.
To that end, now that I have learned a little about how to build a game, I am rewriting Swingman from scratch. The new version is being built to untangle spaghetti-code, and to make things more easily extensible.

Between learning how to use the tools, and the fact that I'm a full-time grad student, Swingman is far from where I would like it to be, even as a demo.  
But in the words of Jason Thor Hall ([Pirate Software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFRT9E0C3XM)): "Go make games". And so I am! Even though its not where I want it to be, I still wanted somewhere to share the progress so far :)
