# Swingman (working title)
See [itch.io](https://zony66.itch.io/swingman) for an executable version of the game.

A little prototype for a game about using a grapple hook, sometimes for platforming and sometimes for solving physics-related puzzles!
This is in the SUPER mega ultra early stages, mostly just thought it'd be cool to post somewhere c:
I've been working on it in my spare time as a physics grad student, so I haven't really been able to give it as much love as I would've liked

This project has been something of a "learners project" for me, which means I have been learning C# and Unity _while_ making the game. 

Between learning how to use the tools, and the fact that I'm a full-time student, Swingman is far from where I would like it to be, even as a demo.  
But in the words of Jason Thor Hall ([Pirate Software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFRT9E0C3XM)): "Go make games". Even though its not where I want it to be, I still wanted somewhere to share the progress so far :)
